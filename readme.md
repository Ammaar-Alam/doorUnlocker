2. **Motor Driver Connections:**
   - Connect the 24V DC motor to the OUT1 and OUT2 terminals of the L298N.
   - Connect IN1 and IN2 on the L298N to digital pins 2 and 3 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the ENA pin to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the 5V pin on the Arduino to the 5V input on the L298N.

3. **[OPTIONAL] LEDs:**
   - Connect the red LED to a digital pin (e.g., pin 10) with a current-limiting resistor.
   - Connect the green LED to another digital pin (e.g., pin 11) with a current-limiting resistor.

4. **[OPTIONAL] Push Buttons:**
   - Connect one side of the push button to the 5V rail.
   - Connect the other side to a digital pin (e.g., pin 4) with a pull-down resistor to ground.

## Software Setup

1. **Arduino IDE:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Install the necessary libraries: WiFiNINA, ArduinoIoTCloud, Arduino_ConnectionHandler.

2. **Arduino IoT Cloud:**
   - Create an account on [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot).
   - Define a new device and link it to your Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.
   - Create a property named `doorOpen` of type `boolean` with read/write permissions.

3. **Web Interface:**
   - The web interface is located in the `public` folder.
   - Update `script.js` to include your Arduino IoT Cloud credentials.

## Arduino Code

The Arduino code is responsible for controlling the motor, updating the door status, and handling BLE connections. The main code is in `door_control.ino` and the BLE-specific code in `ble_control.ino`.

   - Send commands (`0` or `1`) to control the door.

## Troubleshooting

1. **WiFi Connectivity Issues:**
   - Ensure that the correct SSID and password are used in the Arduino sketch.
   - Check if the Arduino is within the range of the WiFi network.
   - Verify if the WiFi network allows connections from IoT devices.

2. **Motor Not Spinning:**
   - Check the connections between the motor driver and the motor.
   - Ensure that the power supply voltage matches the motor's requirement.
   - Verify if the ENA pin is connected and not bypassed.

3. **Arduino Not Responding:**
   - Make sure the Arduino is properly powered.
   - Check if the sketch is correctly uploaded to the Arduino.
   - Ensure the serial monitor is closed when not in use to avoid interference.

## Troubleshooting and Problems Encountered

### 1. **Arduino Getting Stuck on `Serial.begin`**
   - **Issue:** The Arduino would get stuck on `Serial.begin` when not connected to a computer.
   - **Solution:** Ensure the Arduino has a proper power source and is not relying on the serial connection for power.

### 2. **Determining Correct Jumper Settings on L298N**
   - **Issue:** The motor was not spinning due to incorrect jumper settings.
   - **Solution:** Refer to the [L298N Motor Driver Module documentation](https://components101.com/modules/l293n-motor-driver-module) for correct jumper settings.

### 3. **Power Supply Issues**
   - **Issue:** Ensuring the Arduino and motor driver could share a power supply without causing voltage issues.
   - **Solution:** Use a DC-DC buck converter to step down voltage where necessary, and ensure all components are rated for the supplied voltage.

### 4. **Connecting to Eduroam WiFi**
   - **Issue:** Connecting the Arduino to the complex Eduroam WiFi network.
   - **Solution:** Use WPA2 Enterprise settings and ensure the correct identity and credentials are used. Refer to [Eduroam setup guides](https://www.eduroam.org).

### 5. **Motor and Driver Compatibility**
   - **Issue:** Motor driver overheating or not working with the motor.
   - **Solution:** Ensure the motor and driver are compatible in terms of voltage and current ratings. Use proper heat sinks if necessary.

### 6. **Soldering VUSB Pads**
   - **Issue:** Enabling 5V output on Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.
   - **Solution:** Solder the VUSB pads as shown in the Arduino documentation. If soldering tools are not available, seek help from someone experienced.

### 7. **Miscellaneous Hardware Issues**
   - **Issue:** Broken wires, loose connections, and improper use of breadboards.
   - **Solution:** Regularly inspect and replace damaged wires. Ensure all connections are secure and use proper wire stripping and connection techniques.
